            <p>Hi, I’m Owen. I write code and do other things, too. I’m a Minneapolis-based software developer who cares about doing quality work. I love meeting new people, learning new things, and doing cool stuff with computers. This is where I post my projects, but you can also see what I’m working on by checking out my github or linkedin.</p>
